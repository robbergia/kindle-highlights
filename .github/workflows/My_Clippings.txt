For the most part Cnaiür merely watched with a numb kind of incredulity. He no longer heard Kellhus speak so much as observed him cut and carve, whittle and hew, as though the man had somehow shattered the glass of language and fashioned knives from the pieces.

For thirty years he tried to beat his thoughts and passions down the narrow tracks of the Utemot. But despite his brutal persistence, despite his native gifts, his fellow tribesmen could always smell a wrongness about him. In the intercourse between men, every move was constrained by others’ expectations; it was a kind of dance, and as such, it brooked no hesitation. The Utemot glimpsed his flickering doubts. They understood that he tried, and they knew that whoever tried to be of the People couldn’t be of the People.

Many stories begin with a moment of unexpected change. And that’s how they continue too. Whether it’s a sixty-word tabloid piece about a TV star’s tiara falling off or a 350,000-word epic such as Anna Karenina, every story you’ll ever hear amounts to ‘something changed’.

endlessly fascinating to brains. ‘Almost all perception is based on the detection of change’ says the neuroscientist Professor Sophie Scott. ‘Our perceptual systems basically don’t work unless there are changes to detect.’ In a stable environment, the brain is relatively calm. But when it detects change, that event is immediately registered as a surge of neural activity.

Many argue it’s the fundamental way that brains understand abstract concepts, such as love, joy, society and economy. It’s simply not possible to comprehend these ideas in any useful sense, then, without attaching them to concepts that have physical properties: things that bloom and warm and stretch and shrink.

Good stories are explorations of the human condition; thrilling voyages into foreign minds. They’re not so much about events that take place on the surface of the drama as they are about the characters that have to battle them. Those characters, when we meet them on page one, are never perfect. What arouses our curiosity about them, and provides them with a dramatic battle to fight, is not their achievements or their winning smile. It’s their flaws.

When designing a character, it’s often useful to think of them in terms of their theory of control. How have they learned to control the world? When unexpected change strikes, what’s their automatic go-to tactic for wrestling with the chaos? What’s their default, flawed response? The answer, as we’ve just seen, comes from that character’s core beliefs about reality, the precious and fiercely defended ideas around which they’ve formed their sense of self.

When you live alone, your furnishings, your possessions, are always confronting you with the thinness of your existence. You know with painful accuracy the provenance of everything you touch and the last time you touched it. The five little cushions on your sofa stay plumped and leaning at their jaunty angle for months at a time unless you theatrically muss them. The level of the salt in your shaker decreases at the same excruciating rate, day after day. Sitting in Sheba’s house – studying the mingled detritus of its several inhabitants – I could see what a relief it might be to let your own meagre effects be joined with other people’s.

There’s little more thrilling, in a story, than suddenly encountering a mind that is utterly different to ours while being revealing of character and the story to come. The protagonist’s point of view orients us in the story. It’s a map of clues, full of hints about its owner’s flaws and the plot they’re going to create. For me, it’s the single most underrated quality of fiction writing. Too many books and films begin with characters that seem to be mere outlines: perfect, innocent human-shaped nothings, perhaps with a bolt-on quirk or two, waiting to be coloured in by the events of the plot.

Why is it that people associate shapes with tastes at all? One evolutionary account for this is that angular shapes, bitterness and carbonation are all somehow linked with danger or threat. An angular shape could be a weapon, bitterness might indicate poison, while sourness and carbonation would, once upon a time at least, have been an avoidance cue signaling overripe or spoiled foods.

Now think about alternative routes in terms of how a drug acts. Target a particular gene or protein, and the cell redirects metabolic flux to minimise obstructions to function. Just how well it can do this depends on scores of other normally trivial genetic differences, or diet, or other forms of stress such as smoking, weight or age, and these differences account for many of the unpredictable responses to drug treatments. Cancer is a prime example. Drugs typically work for some people but not everyone, or work for a while and then start to falter.

Genes are far more malleable than metabolism.

The textbooks tell us that the Krebs cycle generates energy by stripping out hydrogen atoms from the carbon skeletons of food and feeding them to the ravenous beast that is oxygen (well, they might not put it in exactly those terms). This is the process of cellular respiration. The energy released at each step is ingeniously captured and put to use in the cell, while the inert carcasses of water and carbon dioxide are discharged into the outside world. But why is it a cycle at all? Why not just a few simple steps? Krebs himself suggested one plausible answer: burning very small carbon skeletons is not an efficient process, he argued, so a cycle was necessary.

At some point, our primate ancestors underwent a random genetic mutation that effectively switched on their ability to turn fructose into fat: the gene for the uricase enzyme was “silenced,” or lost. Now, when these apes consumed fructose, they generated lots of uric acid, which caused them to store many more of those fructose calories as fat.

But when we metabolize fructose in large quantities, a different enzyme takes over, and this enzyme does not put the brakes on ATP “spending.” Instead, energy (ATP) levels inside the cell drop rapidly and dramatically. This rapid drop in energy levels makes the cell think that we are still hungry. The mechanisms are a bit complicated, but the bottom line is that even though it is rich in energy, fructose basically tricks our metabolism into thinking that we are depleting energy—and need to take in still more food and store more energy as fat.[

The Warburg effect, also known as anaerobic glycolysis, turns the same amount of glucose into a little bit of energy and a whole lot of chemical building blocks—which are then used to build new cells rapidly.

The more of these networks and subnetworks that we have built up over our lifetime, via education or experience, or by developing complex skills such as speaking a foreign language or playing a musical instrument, the more resistant to cognitive decline we will tend to be. The brain can continue functioning more or less normally, even as some of these networks begin to fail. This is called “cognitive reserve,” and it has been shown to help some patients to resist the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. It seems to take a longer time for the disease to affect their ability to function.

Curiously, APOE e4 was not always a bad actor. For millions of years, all our post-primate ancestors were e4/e4. It was the original human allele. The e3 mutation showed up about 225,000 years ago, while e2 is a relative latecomer, arriving only in the last 10,000 years. Data from present-day populations with a high prevalence of e4 suggest that it may have been helpful for survival in environments with high levels of infectious disease: children carrying APOE e4 in Brazilian favelas are more resistant to diarrhea and have stronger cognitive development, for example.

This is also one area where a ketogenic diet may offer a real functional advantage: when someone is in ketosis, their brain relies on a mix of ketones and glucose for fuel. Studies in Alzheimer’s patients find that while their brains become less able to utilize glucose, their ability to metabolize ketones does not decline. So it may make sense to try to diversify the brain’s fuel source from only glucose to both glucose and ketones.

This ability to use both fuels, fat and glucose, is called “metabolic flexibility,” and it is what we want: in chapters 6 and 7, we saw how the relentless accumulation and spillover of fat drives conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Healthy mitochondria (fostered by zone 2 training) help us keep this fat accumulation in check. A few years ago, San Millán and his colleague George Brooks published a fascinating study that helps illustrate this point. They compared three groups of subjects: professional cyclists, moderately active healthy males, and sedentary men who met the criteria for the metabolic syndrome, meaning essentially that they were insulin resistant. They had each group ride a stationary bicycle at a given level of intensity relative to their fitness (about 80 percent of their maximum heart rate), while the scientists analyzed the amount of oxygen they consumed and the CO2 they exhaled in order to determine how efficiently they produced power—and what primary fuels they were using. The differences they found were striking. The professional cyclists could zoom along, producing a huge amount of power while still burning primarily fat. But the subjects with metabolic syndrome relied almost entirely on glucose for their fuel source, even from the first pedal stroke. They had virtually

The low-calorie mice were found to live the longest, followed by medium-calorie mice, and the high-calorie mice lived the shortest, on average. This was the expected result that had been well established in many previous studies. But then Allison did something very clever. He looked more closely at the high-calorie group, the mice with no maximum limit on food intake, and analyzed this group separately, as its own nonrandomized epidemiological cohort. Within this group, Allison found that some mice chose to eat more than others—and that these hungrier mice actually lived longer than the high-calorie mice who chose to eat less. This was exactly the opposite of the result found in the larger, more reliable, and more widely repeated randomized trial. There was a simple explanation for this: the mice that were strongest and healthiest had the largest appetites, and thus they ate more. Because they were healthiest to begin with, they also lived the longest. But if all we had to go on was Allison’s epidemiological analysis of this particular subgroup, and not the larger and better-designed clinical trial, we might conclude that eating more calories causes all mice to live longer, which we are pretty certain is not the case.

This could suggest that caloric restriction was eliminating early deaths because of the bad Wisconsin diet more than it was actually slowing aging—which is still useful information, as avoiding diabetes and related metabolic disorders is important to our strategy.

is important to remember the limitations of CGM—chiefly, that it measures one variable. This variable happens to be very important, but it is not the only one. Thus, CGM data alone are not going to help you find the ideal diet. Eating bacon for breakfast, lunch, and dinner might give you a great CGM tracing, even though it’s obviously not an optimal diet. Similarly, a bathroom scale will suggest that smoking is good for you because you lost weight. This is why I monitor my patients’ other biomarkers closely as well, to ensure that their CGM-driven choices are not increasing their risk of something else, such as cardiovascular disease. We also monitor other variables that are relevant to diet, beginning with weight (obviously) but continuing with body composition, the ratios of lean mass and fat mass, and how they change. We can also look at biomarkers such as lipids, uric acid, insulin, and liver enzymes. All of these taken together start to give us a better way to evaluate our progress than any one in isolation. Lessons from Continuous Glucose Monitoring In the years that I have used CGM, I have gleaned the following insights—some of which may seem obvious, but the power of confirmation cannot be ignored:

Why is protein so important? One clue lies in the name, which is derived from the Greek word proteios, meaning “primary.”

In fact, the most comprehensive review of this topic, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids for the Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, published by the Cochrane Collaboration in 2018—a 422-page summation of all relevant literature from forty-nine studies, randomizing over twenty-four thousand patients—drew the following conclusion: “Increasing PUFA probably makes little or no difference (neither benefit nor harm) to our risk of death, and may make little or no difference to our risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. However, increasing PUFA probably slightly reduces our risk of heart disease events and of combined heart and stroke events (moderate-quality evidence).” Slight advantage to increasing PUFA, noted.

Why would evolution allow us to spend up to a third of our lives in a state of unconsciousness, where we could easily be killed or eaten? He pressed the issue: Don’t you think natural selection would have eliminated the need to sleep hundreds of millions of years ago—unless, somehow, it was absolutely essential?

By generating seemingly random associations between facts and memories, and by sorting out the promising connections from the meaningless ones, the brain can often come up with solutions to problems that stumped us the previous day. Research has also found that REM sleep is especially helpful with what is called procedural memory, learning new ways of moving the body, for athletes and for musicians.

One drug that we do find helpful for assisting with sleep is trazodone, a fairly old anti-depressant (approved in 1981) that never really took off. At the doses used to treat depression, two hundred to three hundred milligrams per day, it had the unwanted side effect of causing users to fall asleep. But one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. That side effect is what we want in a sleep medication, especially if it also improves sleep architecture, which is exactly what trazodone does—and most other sleep meds do not.[*4] We typically use it at much lower doses, from one hundred milligrams down to fifty milligrams or even less; the optimal dosing depends on the individual, but the goal is to find the amount that improves their sleep quality without next-day grogginess. (We have also had good results with the supplement ashwagandha.)

This may also explain why teenagers want to go to bed late and then sleep in: Our chronotype appears to undergo a temporary shift in adolescence toward late sleeping and later rising. School start times, unfortunately for both teens and for those of us who are parents, remain stubbornly fixed at very early hours—but there is a growing nationwide movement to push school times later, to better suit adolescent sleep schedules.

The most important thing about childhood trauma is not the event itself but the way the child adapts to it. Children are remarkably resilient, and wounded children become adaptive children. The problems begin when these adaptive children grow up to become maladaptive, dysfunctional adults.

It reminded me of this observation by Jacob Riis, the great Danish American journalist and social reformer: “When nothing seems to help, I go back and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred-and-first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not the last blow that did it, but all that had gone before.”

changing the behavior can change the mood. You do not need to wait for your mood to improve to make a behavior change. This is also why cognitive therapies alone sometimes come up short; simply thinking about problems might not help if our thinking itself is disordered.

One tactic that I’ve found especially helpful is called opposite action—that is, if I feel like doing one thing (generally, not a helpful or positive thing), I’ll force myself instead to do the exact opposite. By doing so, I also change the underlying emotions.
